## Technical test Full Stack Developer for Numentech.

## Start app:
### Backend
- Open a new terminal and go to backend folder: `cd backend`
- I added the virtual environment, so just make sure all the requirements are properly installed.
- Activate virtual env with source venv/Scripts/activate and run wsgi.py. Your backend will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)

## Frontend
- Open a new terminal and go to frontend folder: `cd frontend`
- Run `npm install` to install all the packages found in package.json
- Run the development server with `npm run dev`. Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) with your browser to see the result.
